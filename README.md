# Chat Timestamps

Today I had an idea to find a simple mod to add timestamps to my Minecraft chat. When I looked on Modrinth, I found some great options, but they were built for older versions like 1.19. Since I was playing on Fabric 1.21, I decided to create my own!

This mod is lightweight, client-side, and built from the ground up for modern Minecraft versions. I also wanted to make it flexible, so I added a complete configuration screen where you can tailor the timestamps to your exact preferences.
